# This section defines the different services (containers) that make up the application.
services:
  # Defines the MariaDB database service.
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
    container_name: mariadb # Sets a custom name for the container for easier identification.
    networks:
      - inception # Connects this service to the 'inception' network, allowing it to communicate with other services on the same network.
    build:
      context: requirements/mariadb # Specifies the directory containing the Dockerfile for building the MariaDB image.
      dockerfile: Dockerfile  # The name of the Dockerfile to use.

    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql # Mounts a named volume 'mariadb' to the directory where MariaDB stores its data, ensuring data persistence.
    restart: always # Configures the container to restart automatically unless it has been explicitly stopped.
    expose:
      - "3306" # Exposes port 3306 to other services on the same network, but not to the host machine.

  # Defines the Nginx web server service.
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    container_name: nginx
    volumes:
      - wordpress:/var/www/html # Mounts the 'wordpress' volume to Nginx's web root, so it can serve the WordPress files.

    env_file: .env
    ports:

  # Defines the WordPress service.

    restart: always
    expose: 
      - "9000" # Exposes port 9000 for PHP-FPM, allowing Nginx to forward PHP requests to it.

# This section defines the volumes used by the services for data persistence.
volumes:
  # Defines the 'wordpress' named volume.
  wordpress:
    driver: local # Specifies that the volume is managed by the local Docker host.
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none' # No specific filesystem type is enforced.
      o: 'bind' # Specifies that this is a bind mount, linking a host path to the container path.
      device: '/home/wscherre/data/wordpress' # The actual path on the host machine where the WordPress files will be stored.
  # Defines the 'mariadb' named volume.
  mariadb:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: 'none' 
      o: 'bind'
      device: '/home/wscherre/data/mariadb' # The path on the host machine for MariaDB data.

# This section defines the networks used by the services.
networks:
  # Defines the 'inception' network.
  inception:
    driver: bridge # Uses the default bridge network driver, which creates a private network for the containers in this compose file.
